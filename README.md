# 🏥 Hospital Information System (HIS) (Front-End)

## 🎯 Problem Definition

In healthcare facilities, the management of patient data, clinical workflows, and administrative tasks often involves cumbersome paperwork and manual processes. These methods are prone to errors, inefficient, and can lead to delays in patient care. Furthermore, traditional systems may lack integrative features that allow for seamless communication and data retrieval among various departments. Our graduation project, the Hospital Information System (HIS), aims to address these issues by providing a centralized platform where healthcare facilities can efficiently manage all the relevant processes and ensure the delivery of timely and accurate healthcare services.
